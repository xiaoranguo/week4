# Coursera - Developing Data Products - Week 4 Project

An Interactive Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation App

## Getting Started

This project was built on R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15)

### Prerequisites

```
library(shiny)
library(tippy)
```
## The App

* A Makov chain Monte Carlo simulation is a memoryless method of generating a target probability distribution from an initial probability distribution by walking towards the target probability distribution in steps. Each step has some probability of being accepted or rejected by some method.
